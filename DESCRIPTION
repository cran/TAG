Description: Implement the transformed additive Gaussian (TAG) process and the  transformed approximately additive Gaussian (TAAG) process proposed in Lin and Joseph (2020) <DOI:10.1080/00401706.2019.1665592>. These functions can be used to model deterministic computer experiments, obtain predictions at new inputs, and quantify the uncertainty of the predictions.
